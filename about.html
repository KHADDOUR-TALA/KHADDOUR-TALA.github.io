                    <div class="journey-paragraph">
                        <p>I was raised in a conflict-affected country, where limitations were part of daily life. But instead of seeing barriers, I learned to see opportunities for innovation. Where resources were scarce, creativity became abundant.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="journey-paragraph">
                        <p>My journey in robotics didn't begin with circuits and code, but with observation. I watched people around me adapt to physical challenges, witnessed the resilience of the human spirit, and understood that <span class="highlight">pain can give birth to innovation</span>. When you see struggle up close, you develop a deep desire to create solutions.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="journey-paragraph">
                        <p>Through years of conflict and uncertainty, I learned that <span class="highlight">hard work creates destiny</span>. No circumstance, no limitation, no external factor can define what you're capable of achieving. Every challenge became a lesson in resilience, every obstacle a test of determination.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="journey-paragraph">
                        <p>My approach to robotics and intelligent systems is fundamentally human-centered because I believe <span class="highlight">technology should serve humanity</span>, especially those facing the greatest challenges. Whether it's developing rehabilitation devices for stroke survivors or creating accessible AI tools, my goal is to build bridges between technological capability and human need.</p>

                    <div class="journey-paragraph">
                        <p>I've faced numerous rejections and setbacks along the way. Each one taught me that <span class="highlight">failure is not the opposite of success, but part of it</span>. Every "no" strengthened my resolve. Every closed door made me look for windows. Every limitation made me more creative.</p>

                        <p>Today, I stand at the intersection of engineering and human need. My technical skills in robotics, control systems, and AI are tools—but my vision is what gives them purpose. I see a future where intelligent systems don't just perform tasks, but restore dignity. Where robots don't replace humans, but empower them. Where technology heals as much as it advances.</p>

                        <p>The challenges I've faced have given me a unique perspective: I understand what it means to work with limited resources, to innovate under pressure, to find solutions where none seem to exist. These aren't disadvantages—they're superpowers in a world that needs creative problem-solvers.</p>
